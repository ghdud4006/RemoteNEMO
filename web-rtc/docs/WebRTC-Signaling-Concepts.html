            <p>
                Signaling is a process used in <a href="https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/">WebRTC</a> to detect peers; exchange session descriptions to setup media ports; and helps share everything used for initial handshake.

            <p>
                Signaling is used to coordinate communication and send control messages.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Signaling is used to exchange session control messages known as SDP; network configurations as ICE candidatess; and media capabilities using same session control messages.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Signaling can be done either using copy/paste mechanism; or using a gateway like WebSocket, Socket.io, XMPP or most famous one i.e. session initiation protocol (SIP).
            </p>
		
            <p>
                You can use the easiest mechanism as well i.e. POST/GET data from a database using XHR.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                WebRTC signaling process is based on new standard; JSEP: JavaScript Session Establishment Protocol. JSEP is a collection of interfaces for signaling identification; e.g. to identify negotiation of local and remote addresses.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Out of JSEP; signaling processs is not left entirely to the application developer. We need to follow the order of the code!
            </p>
		
            <h2>How the term "signaling" is used in <a href="https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/">WebRTC Experiments</a>?</h2>
		
            <p>
                Approximately all <a href="https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/">WebRTC</a> experiments rely on channels. "Channel" is a term used in realtime protocols like WebSocket to make sure data is transmitted privately over (100%) relevant clients.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Channels are created dynamically for each peer; to make sure SDP/ICE is exchanged among relevant users. 
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Just think about "channels" as a "unique-private-room"; the text messages transmitted over that room is accessible inside the room only. Out siders will NEVER ever be able to access those messages.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Channels concept is same like "namespaces" concept in socket.io. Namespaces allows you broadcast data over single namespace instead of transmitting publicly.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Assume that there are two users; UserA and UserB. <a href="https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/">WebRTC</a> Experiments will setup a new namespace or channel or room; and use it to exchange SDP/ICE/etc. between them. UserA's offer will be shared with UserB using same signaling room; and vice versa.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                In simplest words; you can consider it "signaling room"; a dynamically opened room used to exchange data between two users. Remember, "Signaling rooms" are unique. So, one can't guess/reach others' signaling rooms, until we manually share room-unique-identifier with him.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                "Room unique identifier" is a randomly generated number which is used as access key for the room.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                To share UserA's offer over the room; room-id is used to send/transmit data. UserB i.e. "subscriber" will use same room-id to receive that transmitted data.
            </p>
		
            <h2>What about WebSockets which doesn't have concept like "channels"?</h2>
		
            <p>
                You just need to use a trick on the server side. Look at this structure:
            </p>
		
            <pre class="sh_javascript">
var global_variable_Channels = {
    'channel-1': [websocket1, websocket2],
    'channel-2': [websocket3, websocket4],
    'channel-3': [websocket5, websocket6]
};
</pre>
		
            <p>
                On the server side; capture "transmitted messages" like this:
            </p>
		
            <pre class="sh_javascript">
var global_variable_Channels = {};

websocket.onmessage = function(e) {
    var data = e.data, room;

    // if someone asked to open/join a room
    if (data.openRoom) {
        room = global_variable_Channels[data.roomid];
        if (room)
            room.push(websocket);
        else
            room = [websocket];
    } else {
        // otherwise transmit data over relevant websockets
        var message = data.message;
        
        // capture relevant signaling room
        room = global_variable_Channels[data.roomid];
        
        if (room == null) throw 'No such signaling-room exists.';
        
        // iterate over all websockets using same room-id
        for (var i = 0; i < room.length; i++) {
            var websocket = room[i];
            
            // transmit data over those websockets
            websocket.send(message);
        }
    }
};
</pre>
		
            <p>
                On the client side; open or join a room like this:
            </p>
		
            <pre class="sh_javascript">
websocket.send({
    openRoom: true,
    roomid: Math.random() * 1000
});
</pre>
		
            <p>
                On the client side; you can transmit data like this:
            </p>
		
            <pre class="sh_javascript">
websocket.send({
    message: 'SDP-or-ICE-etc.',
    roomid: 'room-id'
});
</pre>

            <h2 id="xhr">What about XHR i.e. POST/GET? <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/XHR-Signaling" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">An Example</a></h2>
		
            <p>
                Create a table and name it "RoomTable"; add following columns:
            </p>
		
            <ol>
                <li>Room-id</li>
                <li>Owner-id</li>
                <li>Participants-id</li>
                <li>Message</li>
            </ol>
		
            <p>
                Create another table and name it "UserTable"; add following columns:
            </p>
		
            <ol>
                <li>User-id</li>
            </ol>
		
            <p>
                Now, if someone initiates <a href="https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/">WebRTC</a> session; you should make an XHR request to create a record in the room-table; and set "Owner-id" equals to that user's "user-id".
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Now, if someone else joins the room; you can update above record; and append his "user-id" in the "Participants-id" column.
            </p>
		
            <h2>What if I don't want to use socket.io "namespaces"?</h2>
		
            <p>
                Follow process explained for "WebSocket", above.
            </p>
		
            <h2>What if I want to use SIP?</h2>
		
            <p>
                You don't need to worry about "channels" concept; because you already have "sip-uri". SIP unique identifiers can be used to publish/receive messages privately between two users. 
            </p>
		
            <h2>Can you compare "channels" with other signaling methods?</h2>
		
            <p>
                Channels provide us easiest mechanism to transmit data privately over relevant users. It uses less memory comparing other solutions; and this mechanism is capable to setup unlimited channels without any interrupt.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Non-channels based signaling solutions usually stores rooms in an array; same like we did earlier for WebSocket; where you can face memory dump or stack-over-flow issues.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Non-channels based signaling is a little bit slower because we need to iterate over the array to find relevant sockets to transmit data.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Some "novice" users try to handle all things in the client side; which is NEVER recommended. Because such users transmit all messages publicly, this is easily vulnerable and there are huge chance of failures out of buffer-size and other issues.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Remember; NEVER send unneeded messages to a user. Be specific; and keep privacy and make things reliable.
            </p>
		
            <h2>What about server-less signaling?</h2>
		
            <p>
                You can use copy/paste mechanism to share one user's offer with other; and vice versa.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Remember, such things causes delay in setting remote session descriptions for answerer; which may cause failure to setup ports.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                This mechanism also needs a gateway like Email or IMS to share copied text with other user; who will paste and create answer and so on.
            </p>
		
            <h2>What about LAN or intranet?</h2>
		
            <p>
                You always need a signaling gateway; whether it installed publicly or privately. A gateway can be a copy/paste mechanism or a realtime protocol.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                It doesn't matter whether you use custom protocols or topologies for signaling; everything is up to you!
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Just make it done!
            </p>
		
            <h2>What is the difference between ICE server and Signaling server?</h2>
		
            <p>
                Signaling is used to detect peers; and exchange prerequisites to setup media connections.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                ICE which is stands for interactive connectivity establishment is a protocol used to capture public IP addresses of the user. It let us know:
            </p>
		
            <ol>
                <li>Public IP addresses of the user</li>
                <li>It is ipv4 or ipv6</li>
                <li>UDP is blocked or not; otherwise fallback to TCP; otherwise fallback to custom protocol.</li>
            </ol>
		
            <p>
                Some firewalls allow only ports like 443 and 80. 
            </p>
		
            <p>
                So, ICE connectivity establishment is a process used to capture ports and IP addresses and returns "data" back to the browser.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/">WebRTC</a> media engines use those ports and public IP addresses to open ports and stream RTP/RTCP packets.
            </p>
		
            <p>
                RTP contains media packets; and RTCP contains info used to control RTP packets. Both run simultaneously over two unique ports.
            </p>
		
            <h2>
                Differentiating signaling and ICE:
            </h2>
		
            <ol>
                <li>Signaling a process is used to detect peers presence; exchange offer/answer between users; as well as exchange ICE candidates.</li>
                <li>ICE is a process used to capture public IP addresses and ports of the current user. It NEVER exchanges signaling-data between two users.</li>
                <li>There are some ICE servers like TURN that  acts as a media gateway in case when Firewall hide public IP addresses of the NAT. RTP/RTCP packets flows from browser to TURN server to other browser.</li>
                <li>According to third option; TURN can act as media packets exchanger.</li>
            </ol>
		
            <p>
                A media packet is an RTP packet contains audio/video/data blobs. Media packets are shared over UDP ports; however signaling packets are shared over HTTP and/or TCP protocols. 
            </p>
		
            <p>
                Remember, media packets i.e. RTP-packets can be shared over TCP protocol as well.
