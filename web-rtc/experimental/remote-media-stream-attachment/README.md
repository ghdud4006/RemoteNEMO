#### Remote Streams Forwarding

The idea is to attach remote media streams to overcome burden and to manage streaming quality; also to support maximum number of peers connectivity.

If it is audio-only streaming; remote audio streams attachment works perfectly fine. However, video streams seems failing.

Still no prgress to correctly forward "video stream".
