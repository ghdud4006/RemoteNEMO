## How to Deploy?

1) Signup here: 

* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/users/register

2) Use unique-addon-name here: 

* https://github.com/muaz-khan/Firefox-Extensions/blob/master/enable-screen-capturing/package.json#L3 

3) Add your own domains here: 

* https://github.com/muaz-khan/Firefox-Extensions/blob/master/enable-screen-capturing/index.js#L7

4) Make XPI of the directory.

```
[sudo] npm install jpm --global

jpm run -b nightly 		# test in Firefox Nightly without making the XPI

jpm xpi					# it will create xpi file
```

5) Submit the XPI here: 

* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/submit/1

Follow all steps. Read them carefully. This is hard/tough step to follow. Select valid browsers. E.g. Firefox 38 to Firefox 45. And submit your addon for "review".

It will take 2-3 hours for a Mozilla guy to review your addon. Then it will be available to public.
